extends Node

## GXDKRigidBodyBehaviour is a decorator node for RigidBody3D
## and allows us to define additional behaviour characteristics
## when this object is being held by the player.

## If [code]true[/code] and this object is picked up,
## the object is centered on the first hand that picks
## the object up.
## If [code]false[/code] both hands equally effect
## the positioning.
@export var pivot_on_primary: bool = false

## If [code]true[/code] and this object is picked up,
## we apply the same logic as static body,
## e.g. we move the player, not the static body.
@export var grab_as_static_body: bool = false
