## @deprecated
## This player rig is meant for simulation games such as driving games
## or flight simulation.
## It is designed on the assumption this node is placed where the players
## head should be by default.[br]
## [b]Warning[/b]: this will probably be redone at some point in time.

## Maximum distance the players head can be from the origin point before we fade to black.
@export var max_head_distance : float = 0.5

## Distance over which we fade
@export var fade_distance : float = 0.1
